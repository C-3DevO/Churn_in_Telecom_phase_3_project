    "# Telecom Churn Intelligence: A Data-Driven Retention and Risk Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications provider to identify key drivers of attrition. The insights help reduce customer loss, improve retention strategies, and guide resource allocation toward high-value customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluate Churn Risk by Demographics and Services**  \n",
    "   Identify customer groups (e.g., by area code, service plan) most prone to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Contributing Factors to Customer Churn**  \n",
    "   Explore how account features, call activity, and service experience influence churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assess Geographical and Contractual Risk**  \n",
    "   Compare churn rates across area codes and service types to highlight regional or plan-specific risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset**: Customer churn dataset (CSV file)  \n",
    "- **Records**: ~3,333 customers  \n",
    "- **Scope**: Includes demographics, service subscriptions, account details, and churn status  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mapped churn into binary numeric variable (`churn_num`)  \n",
    "- Checked and removed redundant columns  \n",
    "- Encoded categorical variables like `International plan` and `Voice mail plan`  \n",
    "- Conducted hypothesis testing on churn across **area codes**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings & Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective 1: Churn Profiles\n",
    "- Overall churn rate: **14.5%**  \n",
    "- Customers with **International Plans** churned at **42%**, compared to ~11% without.  \n",
    "- Churn was significantly higher among customers with **4+ customer service calls**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective 2: Contributing Factors\n",
    "- Statistical test results showed **area code is not a significant factor** (p > 0.05).  \n",
    "- **Customer service calls** had the strongest correlation with churn.  \n",
    "- High usage (day minutes) also linked to higher churn, likely due to higher charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective 3: Geographic & Contractual Risk\n",
    "- Churn rates across different **area codes** were largely similar.  \n",
    "- **Monthly plans** saw the highest churn compared to long-term contracts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools & Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python 3.11**  \n",
    "- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing  \n",
    "- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – Visualization  \n",
    "- **Scikit-learn, Statsmodels** – Hypothesis testing and analysis  \n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive exploration  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Focus Retention on At-Risk Segments\n",
    "- Prioritize customers with **International Plans** and those making **frequent service calls**.  \n",
    "- Offer proactive outreach, discounts, or loyalty rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Improve Service Experience\n",
    "- Optimize customer service handling to reduce repeat calls.  \n",
    "- Monitor heavy users with high charges to prevent dissatisfaction-driven churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Promote Stable Contract Plans\n",
    "- Encourage migration from monthly contracts to **long-term plans** with incentives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that churn is driven more by **service experience** and **plan type** than by geography. International plan customers, heavy users, and frequent service callers are most at risk. Addressing these segments offers the best opportunity to reduce churn and increase retention.\n",

    "# 4: Exploratory Data Analysis & Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1: Univariate Analysis\n",
    "- **Churn Distribution:** ~85% of customers did not churn, 15% did, indicating class imbalance.  \n",
    "- **Customer Support Calls:** Majority of customers made zero support calls. Frequent calls are rare; highest observed was 8 calls.  \n",
    "- **International Plan:** Only about 10% of customers subscribed to an international plan.  \n",
    "- **Numerical Features:** Charges correlate directly with minutes (day, evening, night, international). Most numeric variables show reasonable ranges and roughly normal distributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2: Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "- **Churn vs International Plan:** Customers with an international plan exhibit higher churn rates, suggesting higher service expectations.  \n",
    "- **Churn vs Customer Service Calls:** Churned customers made more support calls on average, indicating dissatisfaction or unresolved issues.  \n",
    "- **Churn by Area Code:** Area code 415 has the highest total customers and elevated churn. Area codes 408 and 510 have similar volumes but lower churn. (Area code is stored as a string to treat it as categorical, not numeric.)  \n",
    "- **Churn by State:** New Jersey has the highest number of churned customers, followed by Texas, Maryland, and Minnesota.  \n",
    "- **Numerical Feature Correlations:** Strong correlations exist between minutes and corresponding charges (day, evening, night, international). Total minutes strongly correlate with total charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3: Multivariate Analysis\n",
    "- **Total Calls by Churn:** Day, evening, and night calls show similar usage patterns for churned and non-churned customers. International calls are minimal.  \n",
    "- **Minutes & Customer Service Calls vs Churn:** Higher spread in customer service calls among churned customers; day and international minutes show some separation.  \n",
    "- **Total Minutes vs Churn by Voicemail Plan:** Churned customers without voicemail show higher spread and outliers, suggesting voicemail may improve satisfaction.  \n",
    "- **Total Charge vs Churn by International Plan:** Churned customers tend to have higher charges; lack of international plan combined with high charges may increase churn likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5: Inferential Analysis\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Test (Voicemail Plan & Churn):** Significant association exists; customers with voicemail plans behave differently in terms of churn.  \n",
    "- **Independent Samples T-test (Charges & Churn):** Churned customers have significantly higher mean total charges than non-churned customers.  \n",
    "- **One-Way ANOVA (Churn & Area Codes):** No significant difference in mean churn rate across area codes; area code alone does not predict churn.\n"
